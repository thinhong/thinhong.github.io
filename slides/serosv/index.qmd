## Notes

All methods are applied assume that we have a representative cross-sectional serosurvey

# Binary serostatus data

## 1. Cumulative incidence = attack rate

$$\text{Cumulative incidence} = \frac{\text{seropositive}}{\text{sample size}}$$

Adjust for test performance (sensitivity, specificity):

-   Rogan-Gladen estimator [@rogan1978]
-   Binomial model [@larremore2021]

## 2. Ascertainment rate

The proportion of infections which are captured within surveillance systems.

$$\text{Ascertainment rate} = \frac{\text{cumulative incidence estimated from routine surveillance (syndromic cases)}}{\text{cumulative incidence estimated from serological data}}$$

## 3. Infection-fatality ratio (IFR)

$$\text{IFR} = \frac{\text{cumulative number of deaths}}{\text{cumulative incidence estimated from serological data}}$$


$$S(a) = e^{-\lambda a}$$

$$\frac{dS}{da} = -\lambda e^{-\lambda a} = -\lambda S(a)$$

Proportion of seropositive $\pi(a)$:

$$\pi(a) = 1 - S(a) = 1 - e^{-\lambda a}$$
