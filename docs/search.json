Someone will always be late, and you’ve decided to wait a few minutes for them. Even if no one is late, it’s better to ease everyone a bit before moving on to the main session. All eyes are on you now, and it’s time to begin.\n\nIf everyone is new, start by introducing yourself and then let each person take a turn to introduce themselves. To break the ice, choose someone at random and ask a question; they’ll surely appreciate it.\nIf there are only some new faces, let them introduce and pose 1-2 questions to them.\nIf you’re already familiar with the group, kick off by randomly selecting someone and ask how it’s going last week. Add a joke or two if you’re in the mood."

But make sure that you achieve each objective before moving on to the next topic. If you only focus on timing and changing topics, people should bring in a robot to chair the meeting instead of you."

If it becomes quiet (unintentionally), you have to start talking.

How about a funny person who takes it a bit too far and starts to irritate others (the Clown)? Or maybe someone who consistently goes off-topic, putting meeting objectives at risk (the Diverter)? It is your responsibility to bring them back on track. Who else holds more authority than you in this meeting?\nThere are many ways to handle this, but from my view, two steps work: (1) recognize their points, (2) asking someone else to share their thoughts. This is a chance to encourage quieter individuals to speak up. Pay attention to them because otherwise they will always keep silent. Also, this approach sends a signal to those who talk a lot, reminding them to give others a chance."
