Someone will always be late, and you’ve decided to wait a few minutes for them. Even if no one is late, it’s better to ease everyone a bit before moving on to the main session. All eyes are on you now, and it’s time to begin.\n\nIf everyone is new, start by introducing yourself and then let each person take a turn to introduce themselves. To break the ice, choose someone at random and ask a question; they’ll surely appreciate it.\nIf there are only some new faces, let them introduce and pose 1-2 questions to them.\nIf you’re already familiar with the group, kick off by randomly selecting someone and ask how it’s going last week. Add a joke or two if you’re in the mood."

But make sure that you achieve each objective before moving on to the next topic. If you only focus on timing and changing topics, people should bring in a robot to chair the meeting instead of you."

If it becomes quiet (unintentionally), you have to start talking.

How about a funny person who takes it a bit too far and starts to irritate others (the Clown)? Or maybe someone who consistently goes off-topic, putting meeting objectives at risk (the Diverter)? It is your responsibility to bring them back on track. Who else holds more authority than you in this meeting?\nThere are many ways to handle this, but from my view, two steps work: (1) recognize their points, (2) asking someone else to share their thoughts. This is a chance to encourage quieter individuals to speak up. Pay attention to them because otherwise they will always keep silent. Also, this approach sends a signal to those who talk a lot, reminding them to give others a chance."

Could you suggest me a very short but efficient way how are we going to work on this?\n\n\nWe can use just two steps for every thought you bring here:\nStep 1. Ask: 👉 “Is this happening right now in reality, or only in my head?”\nStep 2. Label:\nReality → something you can see, hear, touch, or prove.\nThought → story, fear, memory, or prediction.\nThat’s it. I’ll help you do the labelling when you write your thoughts here. Over time, you’ll start doing it automatically.\nDo you want me to keep the answers very short (just “Reality” or “Thought”), or would you prefer a tiny bit of explanation each time?"

Let me ask you step by step:\n\nPurpose: Why do you want to learn finance basics? (e.g., personal money management, investing, understanding economics, career development, etc.)\nLevel: Do you want a very simple, beginner-friendly explanation (like everyday examples), or a bit more structured (with some technical terms, formulas, etc.)?\nFormat: How do you prefer to learn? (e.g., short lessons, Q&A style, exercises, summaries, real-life applications)\nFocus areas: Finance is broad. Which areas interest you most? Personal finance (budgeting, saving, debt, retirement planning), Investing (stocks, bonds, funds, property), Business finance (cash flow, profit/loss, company value), Economics & money systems (banks, inflation, central banks)\nTime: How much time do you want to spend learning (daily/weekly)? Do you prefer a quick crash course or a slower step-by-step path?\n\n👉 Once you answer these, I’ll put everything together into a clear, ready-to-use prompt that you can copy/paste to guide our finance learning journey."
