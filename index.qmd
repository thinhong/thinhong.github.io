Hello! I'm **Thinh** - feel free to pronounce it as ***"think"***. I'm a medical doctor focusing on preventive medicine. I'm pursuing my DPhil degree in Mathematical Modelling at the University of Oxford.

I've documented everything I've learned throughout my career on this website. Here you can find:

* Practical guides for **leadership**, **management**, **R programming**, and **data science** (on my [**blog**](/blog.html))
  
* My teaching materials on **mathematical modelling** methods for **infectious diseases** and **R programming** (on my [**teaching**](/teaching.html))
