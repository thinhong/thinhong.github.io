Hello! I'm **Thinh** - feel free to pronounce it as ***/think/***. I'm a medical doctor pursuing my DPhil degree in Mathematical Modelling at the University of Oxford.

*Docendo discimus*, the best way to learn is to teach. I've documented everything I've learned throughout my career on this website. Here you can find:

* Practical guides for **leadership**, **R programming**, and **data science** (on my [**blog**](blog))
  
* My teaching materials on **mathematical modelling** methods for **infectious diseases**, **R programming** and **others** (on my [**teaching**](teaching))
