Hello! I'm **Thinh** - feel free to pronounce it as ***"think"***. I'm a medical doctor pursuing my DPhil degree in Mathematical Modelling at the University of Oxford.

I've documented everything I've learned throughout my career on this website. Here you can find:

* Practical guides for **leadership**, **management**, **R programming**, and **data science** (on my [**blog**](/blog.html))
  
* My teaching materials on **mathematical modelling** methods for **infectious diseases** and **R programming** (on my [**teaching**](/teaching.html))
